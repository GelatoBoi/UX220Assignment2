<h2>
Air Cadets: A Saga
</h2>

<p>
If I had to say what was my biggest commitment throughout my entire life, I would say Air Cadets for sure. I spent the whole six years of my life dedicating myself to this program. I have so many memories of me in cadets, whether it was me taking my survival instructor course or teaching the level ones. To this day, I honestly miss it. I've met so many people because of it and made so many friends. If I were to do it again, I would say yes, for sure. In all honesty, even though I've been through my ups and downs In this program I would still give this an A+.
