<h2>
FCT Internship
</h2>

<p>
Recently during the summer, I took up an offer for an internship at a title Insurance Company named FCT. I did it just this summer, in 2023 from May To September, And I have to say it was pretty helpful. Not only is it going to help me build a User experience design career for the future, It also helped me with my design and software skills, as well as my communication skills.
I'm pretty grateful that I got the opportunity there because not only was my team very Collaborative, they were also very compassionate and kind. At the end of the internship, they took me out for dinner, which I'm forever grateful for. If I had to give this a grade, I would say it was an A+.
