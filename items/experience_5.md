Taekwondo

<p>
Last but not least, another commitment that I've made in my life That I've actually previously mentioned in an earlier assignment is My passion for Taekwondo. I've been doing it since early high school and now it's been close to up to 6 years now. Just like swimming, it helped me not only build up physically but also mentally as well, as my Taekwondo teacher has told us some of his past experiences and stories to learn from. Not only this, but I ended up learning sometimes very similar experiences Myself during that my Taekwondo career. Sometimes facing your opponents can be very humbling, let's just say thatâ€¦ If I had to give this a letter grade, I would say an A+.
