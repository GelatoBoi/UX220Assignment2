Marble Slab Creamery

<p>
I will take you back even more further in time, to a time when I wasn't in university. 
Back when I was young during my high school years, I was very passionate and looking forward to getting a job. 
That's when, in my search, I was able to land a job at An ice cream store named Marble Slab Creamery. I did this job for many years throughout my high school career, Sometimes I can't even keep track of how long I did it! However, if I were to say, I would say I did it for a little over 2 years. Of course it was a good job to have in high school because I could save up money, and led me to meet a lot of interesting personalities over the years. The best part, however Was the fact that my old high school crush actually still work at the Shoppers Drug Mart right across from me, So every time she came in the store, I would be super happy to meet her. I even still remember her favorite topping! Honestly, because of that, it was all worth it. If I had to give this a letter grade, it would be a B+.
