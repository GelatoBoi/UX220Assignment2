<h2>
Swim Instructor
</h2>

<p>
Another commitment I've made in my life is the sport of swimming. For years and throughout most of my high school career, I've achieved from going from bronze medallion all the way up to getting my swim instructors certificate. It was a rough road for sure, However, it did help me not only build me physically, but also help me mentally overcome some challenges as well. Swimming has really taught me a lot about the lesson of failure and moving on from it. Just like every other commitment on this list, I made lots of friends during my time here, even if there were only just temporary. If I were to give a letter grade for this commitment, it would be hard, but I would say it would be B+.
